# Phishing Website Detection with Random Forest

This Colab notebook demonstrates how to build a phishing website detection model using the Random Forest algorithm. The model can be used to predict whether a given website is phishing or legitimate.

## Data

The dataset used in this notebook contains URLs along with their corresponding labels (phishing or legitimate). The dataset has been loaded and preprocessed for training.

## Preprocessing

Before training the model, the URLs are preprocessed to extract their domain information using regular expressions. The extracted domains are used as input features for the model. One-hot encoding is also performed for the categorical input features.

## Training

A Random Forest classifier is created and trained on the preprocessed dataset. The model is evaluated for accuracy on the training set.

## Prediction

Once the model is trained, it can be used to predict whether a given URL is a phishing website or not. The user can input a URL, and the model will classify it accordingly.

### How to Use the Notebook

1. Load the dataset: Upload the dataset containing URLs and their corresponding labels ('phishing' or 'legitimate'). Ensure that the dataset is in CSV format and has columns labeled 'URL' and 'Label'.

2. Run the code: Execute each code cell sequentially to preprocess the data, train the Random Forest model, and define the prediction function.

3. Prediction: When prompted, enter the URL you want to check if it's phishing or legitimate. The model will then provide the prediction result.

### Additional Considerations

- Data Exploration: To gain insights into the dataset, consider adding data exploration and visualization before training the model.

- Model Evaluation: Include other evaluation metrics besides accuracy, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: Explore hyperparameter tuning techniques to optimize the Random Forest model's performance.

- Error Analysis: Perform an error analysis to understand why the model misclassifies certain URLs.

- Visualization: Consider visualizing the decision tree(s) from the Random Forest model to help users understand the decision process.

- Handling Edge Cases: Address potential edge cases in the preprocessing and prediction steps, such as handling invalid or empty URLs.

- Handling URL Redirections: Handle URL redirections in the preprocessing step to extract the final destination domain from redirect URLs.

- Deployment: If deploying the model in a real-world scenario, provide instructions on how to export the model for later use and integrate it into web applications or other systems.
